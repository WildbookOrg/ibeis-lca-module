"""
The interface to the database asks for properties like nodes, edges,
clusters and cluster ids. These are deliberately abstracted from the
design of Wildbook. Their current Wildbook analogs are annotations,
edges, marked individuals and their UUIDs. Since this could change in
the future and we also hope that the algorithm could be used for other
applications, we keep the terms of interface abstract.

All edges are communicated as "quads" where each quad is of the form
  (n0, n1, w, aug_name)
Here, n0 and n1 are the nodes, w is the (signed!) weight and aug_name
is the augmentation method --- a verification algorithm or a human
annotator -- that produced the edge.  Importantly, n0 < n1.

X As currently written, nodes are not added to the database through this
X interface. It is assumed that these are entered using a separate
X interface that runs before the graph algorithm.

Nodes are generally added implicitly through adding edges, but as a
safety precaution all nodes in the clustering also added. This will
only add nodes that are disconnected from others in graph; such nodes
do not participate in the graph algorithm and are only recorded here
to avoid errors.

I suspect we can implement this as a class hierarchy where examples and
simulation are handled through one subclass and the true database
interface is handled through another.
