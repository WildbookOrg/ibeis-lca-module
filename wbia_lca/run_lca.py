4. Run LCA AFTER candidate matches have been established

    4a. The aids should be the combination of the query aids
        and the database daids from above. It is possible to
        run ranking multiple times with different annotation
        sets before running LCA. This will work as long as all

5. Simulation requires some work:

    a. Run ranking and LCA to get to a place in the experiments on
       your annotations just before you'd like to start the simulation.
       Specifically, suppose the annotations you'd like to run queries for
       during a simulation are in a list called qaids.  Then you should
       pause computation just after running ranking on the qaids against
       the daids you'd like to target.

    b. Manually create backup copies of the database files that are
       in /data/db/_ibsdb: _ibeis_staging.sqlite3 and _ibeis_database.sqlite3
       Do this in a temporary directory outside the /data/db/_ibsdb
       directory. You may need to exit and restart the ipython shell,
       but I don't think so.

    c. Back in the ipython shell, run_lca to completion in the normal
       way, with use_simulated_human_reviews set to False. Make sure
       that the file named in
              OVERALL_CONFIG['clustering_result_filepath']
       is succcessfully created by the _plugin. It will contain the
       clustering results that you will compare against.  The results are
       saved as a pickled dictionary mapping from aid to nid --- aids with
       the same nid are in the same cluster.

    d. Gather whatever statistics you need on the results for comparison
       and then exit the ipython shell.  The focus here should be on human
       review statistics and other things you might want to remember aside
       from the actual clustering.

    e. Restore the manually-copied databases and start the ipython shell,
       and change whatever you wish to change in the configuration (such
       as using short-circuiting).

    f. Using the exact same set of aids (union of the qaids and daids
       from setp a), call run_lca, but this time with
            OVERALL_CONFIG['use_simulated_human_reviews'] set to True
       and with
            OVERALL_CONFIG['clustering_gt_filepath'] set to what was
       saved as
            OVERALL_CONFIG['clustering_result_filepath']
       In addition, create a new file name for
            OVERALL_CONFIG['clustering_result_filepath']
       to store new clusering results.

    g. Repeat steps e through f as needed.  Importantly, set a new value for
            OVERALL_CONFIG['clustering_result_filepath']
       every time you run a different configuration and want a different
       set of results.

    h. Gather and save statistids on reviews, etc.  The most important
       statistics are on the number of short-circuited reviews.  You can see
       this in the LCAActor (in _plugin.py) method called _attempt_short_circuit_review
       It prints the incremental statistics to the log file.  Remember that the
       log file is continually added to, so if you don't gather results (or make a copy)
       before restarting, you'll get results from multiple runs.


6. Changes to the preceeding simulation steps if you've already run to completion

    a. Decide on your qaids and daids as above.

    b. Make sure there is a file whose name is stored as
              OVERALL_CONFIG['clustering_gt_filepath']
       as in 5f. If there is no ground truth file, then using the union of the qaids
       and daids (call it just aids) type:
              nids = ibs.get_annot_nids(aids)
              aids_to_nids = {a: n for a, n in zip(aids, nids)}
              ut.save_cPkl(fp, aids_to_nids)
       where fp is the desired filepath to the clustering ground truth.  (I've done
       this on 2023-07-13)

    c. Make a backup copy of the database as in step 5b, but this stores the
       completed state of LCA rather than the preliminary state.

    d. Remove all edges and reviews between any aids in qaids and any in daids.
       If qaids == daids this will be all edges and reviews. Remove all names as well, like so:
                nids = ibs.get_annot_nids(aids)
                ibs.delete_names(nids)

    e. Run ranking on the qaids against the daids as in 5a.

    f. Make a backup copy of this "initial" database as in step 5b.  You will now
       have two database copies, one is initial and one is, essentially, final.

    g. Continue with steps 5d through 5h.

   When you are done with experiments, restore the database you saved in 6c to
   return to "real" results
